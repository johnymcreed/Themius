                Welcome to <b>Themius Extension</b> created to automate my css to anyones 
                browser without needing them to manually update there style everytime I fix or add something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also allows for custom choices between what you want and what you don't want with this style.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm happy this has gotten so far as it is truely the best project I have started in a very long time 
                that has actually gotten somewhere with a goal unlike most of my projects.
            </p>
