<header type="45">Introduction</header>
<p>
    This will be the biggest page out of all the pages from this docs website, it contains a lot of how the website functions and almost every classing element
    the website contains from <code>tags</code> to <code>scripts</code> to give you almost every detail of the website.
</p>
<p>
    Unless you understand <code>CSS</code>, <code>HTML</code>, or <code>PHP</code> I would recommend not using this page for anything as it will not
    give you any benifents.
</p>

<header type="45">root</header>
<p>
    Not used for a lot other than Global css variables for the website mainly to give everything an automation with changing through themes like
    <code>dark-mode</code> or <code>light-mode</code> which both have custom variables in <code>:root</code>.
</p>

<header type="45">ng-star-inserted</header>
<p>
    <code>ng-star-inserted</code> is the websites global class used for everything, like <code>app-tree.ng-star-inserted</code> or from simple things like
    div elements or text elements.

<p>
    Based off <code>:root</code> but is a tag element that presents any elements in it with global effects from several classes like <code>app-theme</code>
