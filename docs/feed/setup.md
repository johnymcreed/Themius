# Introduction
Thanks to my creativity with javscript I went out of my way to make a google extension **(Not avaliable on google)** that allows for automatic updates to the styling part of echo, it also has an version checker to make sure your extension is up-to-date with the latest version of it!

# Installing
Adding **Themius Extension** to your browser is incredibly easy due to how it is added to most common browsers like **Opera**, **Chrome**, **Firefox**, ect. 

Firstly click <a href="update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> to download the latest version of the extension and extract it to a place you can easily find it incase a new version is relased.

Then go to you're extension page which should be like `opera://extensions` or `chrome://extensions` to open to the extension page. then (if needed) go and click **developer mode** to allow the final step. finally click **Load Unpacked** and go to the newly extracted `extension` folder where you extracted it and select it. 

There you go, you have Themius added which should start effecting ECHO as soon as it is enabled (if it doesn't refresh the page once to load it).

# Info
Since themius has been renovated and has several new features now like **force resubmit** and **paste detection** i might aswell add this here so you know what
you are seeing on ECHO.

Firstly, **Paste Detection** you will see in any text editor on ECHO a squiqqly underline under words you just pasted. this means that teachers can see its pasted

Secondly, **Force Resubmit** if you are late to an assignment and miss its due date and the teacher sets it to it not allow submits past a date then this will bypass this at the cost that you cannot use the toolbar at the top of the editor.

thats it. for now ðŸ˜ƒ
