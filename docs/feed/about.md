# Themius
Welcome to [Themius](https://github.com/johnymcreed/Themius) a theme that redesigns **Echo**.
Themius aims to make Echo turn into a more friendly and more useable interface then what echo originally provides to the everyday users by 
optimizing several parts of the website and fixing serveral elements to make the ultimate web-page for your everyday use in school, thats if you even use echo. 

You might find that Themius makes Echo feel more smooth, and simple compared to Echos original styling. This is not by accident, we made it this way
because we want you to feel at home when working at school which is why we made Themius for Echo.

We make sure Themius is always updated with Echo and are always at it with new additions and fixes that make Echo feel like a professional platform to
do work on, on a day to day basis.

So? lets get started! go <a href="/Themius/setup">Here</a>

# Frequently Asked Questions
This sections goal is to answer most of the questions we receive about Themius most asked questions.

<br>

### Why did you make this?
I created Themius because I hated the original theme that Echo provided as it was an eye sore for 8 hours a day, which was
just something I didn't want to deal with. So I created Themius to make my life better.

### What is Paste Detection?
This was something I found out but apparently `#IsPasted` is used in `.comments-ct` as a simple detector for when
you use **ctrl + v** in the text box. I added this because it wanted to know when a teacher knew something was pasted.

### What is Force-Resubmission?
This is a function in the extension that allows you to resubmit assignments that are locked via a assigned date that was passed
this is a helpful feature if you commonly don't turn in assignments on time.
