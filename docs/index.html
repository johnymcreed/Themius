                    <p>Welcome to <a href="https://github.com/johnymcreed/Themius">Themius</a> a stylus theme that redesigns <b>Echo</b>.</p>
                    <p>
                        Themius aims to make Echo turn into a more friendly and more useable interface then what echo originally provides to the everyday users by 
                        optimizing several parts of the website and fixing serveral elements to make the ultimate web-page for your everyday use in school, thats if you even use echo. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might find that Themius makes Echo feel more smooth, and simple compared to Echos original styling. This is not by accident, we made it this way
                        because we want you to feel at home when working at school which is why we made Themius for Echo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We make sure Themius is always updated with Echo and are always at it with new additions and fixes that make Echo feel like a professional platform to
                        do work on, on a day to day basis.
                    </p>

                    <header type="45">Frequently Asked Questions</header>
                    <p>This sections goal is to answer most of the questions we receive about Themius most asked questions.</p>
                    <p>
                        <header type="35">Why did you make this?</header>
                        I created Themius because I hated the original theme that Echo provided as it was an eye sore for 8 hours a day, which was
                        just something I didn't want to deal with. So I created Themius to make my life better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <header type="35">What is Paste Detection?</header>
                        This was something I found out but apparently <code>#IsPasted</code> is used in <code>.comments-ct</code> as a simple detector for when
                        you use <b>ctrl + v</b> in the text box. I added this because it wanted to know when a teacher knew something was pasted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <header type="35">Can i edit elements?</header>
                        To answer this, <b>Yes</b>. You can edit any element within the <code>theme.css</code> file givin to you. I recommend you don't if you have
                        no skill with css or coding in general.
